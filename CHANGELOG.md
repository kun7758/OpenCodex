## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added bounded parallel execution for independent read-only tools with deterministic result order.
- Added stale-file edit protection, artifact-backed oversized results, and deferred tool discovery.
- Added bootstrap profiles, richer diagnostics, session forking, and layered memory controls.
- Expanded MCP support for pagination, list-change notifications, prompts, templates, roots,
  elicitation, and cancellation.

### Changed

- Unified gitignore handling across search and diagnostics tools.
- Improved checkpoint safety for created, modified, and deleted files.
- Strengthened model routing with token budgets, retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, and local
  model selection.
- Centralized slash-command dispatch and tool execution policy.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added context-line support to `grep_code`.
- Added GitHub Actions quality checks and Python 3.11/3.12 test jobs for pushes and pull requests.
- Added runtime-owned cancellation handles spanning shell processes, MCP, web requests, sub-agents,
  automation, the SDK, and the TUI.
- Added workspace- and content-digest-bound trust for project hooks and plugin contributions.
- Added centralized model profiles and a side-effect-free tool inspection catalog.

### Changed

- Expanded the TUI workbench with richer context, task, activity, file, decision, and source
  presentation.
- Reduced unnecessary approval prompts in `auto` permission mode while preserving hard blocks,
  explicit policy rules, sandbox restrictions, and audit records.
- Limited permission prompts to the actionable approve-or-cancel choices.
- Isolated task managers, tool identifiers, event listeners, and cleanup ownership by runtime and
  session.
- Strengthened session path identity, process sandbox read boundaries, provider error handling,
  plugin contribution refresh, and SDK resource lifecycle management.

- Fixed automatic context compression, repeated-summary interpolation, atomic assistant/tool
  message insertion, and Anthropic tool-only serialization.
- Prevented configuration and tool-event output from exposing expanded secrets.
- Prevented untrusted, revoked, or content-drifted project extensions from remaining active in the
  current runtime.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added canonical runtime state projections and subscriptions for consistent TUI and SDK updates.
- Added atomic JSONL session schema v2 snapshots with replayable transcript events, plan/runtime
  state, revision data, legacy loading, and exact duplicate-message collapse.

### Changed

- Updated all current user and developer documentation for the Textual-only interactive
  experience.

  picker, transcript replay, same-session resume persistence, 39 built-in tools, security,
  extensions, SDK events, and current architecture.
- Marked development plans 01-13 as archived design records rather than current product
  documentation.
- Improved plan decisions and synchronization, plan step reindexing, saved-plan parsing, Option
  shortcuts, progress presentation, and manual scroll preservation.

### Fixed

- Fixed plan execution state transitions and blocked implementation tools while Plan mode is
  active.
- Fixed interrupted approved plans so they can resume from persisted state.
- Restored Windows TUI mouse-wheel scrolling.
- Updated the generated project-guide command example so it no longer recommends the removed
  `opennova tui` command.
