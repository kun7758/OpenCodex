In plan mode, you'll:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools
2. If a saved plan already exists, read the existing saved plan first before making changes
3. Understand existing patterns and architecture
4. Design an implementation approach
5. Present your plan to the user for approval
6. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches
7. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement

## When to Use This Tool

**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure
4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies
5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding full scope
7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways

## Important Notes

- This tool REQUIRES user approval before implementation
- If the user explicitly asked to plan before implementation, call this tool before any
  write_file, edit_file, multi_edit_file, create_file, delete_file, or execute_command
  that changes the project.
- Once in plan mode, explore thoroughly and create a detailed plan before calling ExitPlanMode
